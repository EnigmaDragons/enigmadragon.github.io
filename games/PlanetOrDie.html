        <p>You are Stilles 33, the tiniest planet.
            Scientists continually change their definitions as they refine their understand of the world.
            Pluto used to be a planet. Eris used to be a planet. Your classification as a planet is now at risk!
            Use powerful rhetoric and all the best logical fallacies to outwit your opponent and convince an impartial academic crowd that you are actually a planet.</p>

            Great game, great intro! The graphics, music and sounds and most importantly the dialogues are also pretty good.<br>
            Excellent! Very humerous and fun game. Hats off for the idea and story… Cleanly coded with elegant graphics.<br>
            A really fun experience. I was laughing my butt off on some of those statements. Great entry!<br>
            Wow, after that intro I was not expecting that. I have to say I am happy with my closing statement accusing the guy of being a dark soul and then finishing with I am a fucking planet.<br>
            This was really cool. A smacked the first guy down hard. I thought for sure I had the second guy, Calling him a jealous Pluto, but nay, I got blowed up.<br>
            Awesome game, very funny and well written. Great art and music, very strong entry overall.<br>
            lol, dat Ace Attorney mechanics applied to such silly(in good way) theme! Very fresh and original, and good execution too. Thank you for good laugh.<br>
            Funniest game I’ve ever played in a Ludum Dare, hands down.<br>
            I had a lot of fun playing this; quirky, humorous, and intriguing! I HAD to play a few times to see all the endings I could get!<br>
            Wow! Funniest game ive played this LD XD Its so cool… I managed to beat it and it felt awsome to finally be considered a real planet :D
