# Engima Dragons - Workflow Policy

----

## Overview

#### Enigma Dragons is a results-only work environment. 

- We care about what is delivered, and not how long something takes. 
- We communicate in clear and simple requirements. Every ticket should be as simple as possible.
- We value rapid iteration. We merge to master as frequently as possible.
- We write clean code. Code should be built for a team to read and evolve.
- We grant autonomy. Every developer should be given freedom to work how, when, and on what they wish.
- We believe in ownership. You are responsible for your role. You call the shots. You get the credit.

----

## 1. Workflow Process

- All work must happen against Github tickets.
- All active tickets must have a Role label.
- To begin work on a ticket, ensure that the ticket is assigned to you and is moved to the "In Progress" column.
- Only work on 1, or at most 2, ticket(s) at a time.
- If you wish to work on a ticket outside your role consult the ARC or Design Lead first
- Every ticket that is finished must result in a Git commit with the new artifacts (code, document, art)

----

## 2. Rapid Iteration

- For projects that use an approval process, approvals should be prioritized over new work.
- For non-art tasks, no ticket should take more than 60-90 minutes.
- If you discover that more work is needed, create a new ticket and deliver what you have.
- As long as you made substantial progress in delivering the target feature, that's all we need.
- If a ticket is taking a lot more work than you expected, reach out for help.
- Any team member may create a ticket for work they think is needed for the project.

----

## 3. Ownership Process

- Role Leads are listed in the README document for the project.
- Within his role, the role lead makes all final decisions about his area of focus.
- While working on a ticket, you may make your own decisions about how to implement a feature.

----

## 4. Ticket Process

- New tickets must be created in `Incoming`.
- Ticket must have a clear and simple title.
- Ticket must have a Role label.
- Ticket may have a short description, including images, or more detailed requirements.
- If a description isn't needed, don't include one.
- Anyone on the project may create tickets as desired.
- Project Architect and Role Leads can move tickets onto the work board.

----

## 5. Approval Process

### Game Jams
- For Game Jams, no approval is needed. 

### Formal Development
- A reviewer must approve every PR.
- The PR must pass all CI checks.
- Every PR must include a commit with a message linking it to the associated ticket such as `Closes #34`.

----

## 6. Done

A ticket is done when all of the following are true:
- The Ticket is marked Closed 
- Its artifacts have been merged to `master`.

----

## A. Paid Work Guidelines

----

- For paid work, you are owed payment for a ticket after it is done.
- Payment schedules and rates are worked out prior to joining the project.
- Upon request, any unpaid balance will be sent to you within 48hrs.
