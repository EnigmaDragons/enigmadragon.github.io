### Background

Enigma Dragons was founded as a hobbyist project in 2016 and moved into the Game Jam world in 2017. Experiencing tremendous success in the Game Jam circuit, receiving critical acclaim for content, humor, gameplay, art, and audio, in 2019 Enigma Dragons began work on their first commercial games, and is preparing for the release of the brain-sizzling puzzle game BitVault.<br>

Two things that make Enigma Dragons unique are:
- Enigma Dragons uses a fully distributed work model in order to maximize international collaboration. There is no physical studio building
- Enigma Dragons embraces a results-only work model, which stands in stark distinction to the hourly and salaried work models of conventional studios
